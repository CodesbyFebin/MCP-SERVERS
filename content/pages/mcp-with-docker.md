# MCP with Docker

## Introduction

Deploying MCP servers with Docker enables consistent, portable, and scalable deployments. This guide shows you how to use MCP with Docker.

## Dockerfile for MCP Servers

```dockerfile
FROM node:20-alpine

WORKDIR /app

COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

EXPOSE 3000

CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mcp-server:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
    environment:
      - API_KEY=${API_KEY}
    volumes:
      - ./data:/app/data
```

## Setup

1. Create Dockerfile for your MCP server
2. Configure Docker Compose
3. Build and run containers
4. Test MCP connectivity

## Best Practices

- Use multi-stage builds
- Minimize image size
- Use environment variables
- Implement health checks

## Conclusion

Docker enables consistent MCP server deployments. Use containers for development, testing, and production.

# How to Implement MCP Rate Limiting

## Introduction
Rate limiting protects MCP servers from abuse and ensures fair usage.

## Implementation
```typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit'

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000,
  max: 100
})

server.use('/mcp', limiter)
```

## Strategies
- Token bucket
- Sliding window
- Per-client limits

## Conclusion
Rate limiting is essential for production MCP servers.
